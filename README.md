# Phase 4 Final Project: Job Market App

## Project Description
This application is a simplified version of the online job market. There are two types of user account, employer and applicant account. The employer account is to make new job postings, to review applications and to update hiring decisions for the employer's job postings. And the applicant account is to view a list of jobs posted, to apply for jobs, and to check application status. 

The frontend application is developed using react and semantic ui react, and the backend application is developed using Flask.
